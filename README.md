Developed in Processing (Java), it is meant to visualise over 500k flights in the USA in terms of:
* Total and total diverted/cancelled/late/on-time flights, per user-selected airports as charts
* (Estimated) Carbon Emission Information, per user-selected airports. Includes a calculation of how many trees are needed to offset these estimates.

## Group Members are:
* Scott McNally 
* Grigoris Ioannis Manitaras
* Alexander Judge
